 * GameDefinition Type System

 * - TMoves: Available moves (record of move names to move arg types)
 * - TCardDefinition: Static card definition type
 * - TCardMeta: Dynamic card metadata type
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * type MyGameState = {
 *   players: Player[];
 *   currentPlayer: number;
 * };
 *
 * type MyMoves = {
 *   playCard: { cardId: string };
 *   pass: {};
 * };
 *
 * type MyCardDef = {
 *   id: string;
 *   name: string;
 *   cost: number;
 * };
 *
 * type MyCardMeta = {
 *   damage?: number;
 *   tapped?: boolean;
 * };
 *
 * const game: GameDefinition<MyGameState, MyMoves, MyCardDef, MyCardMeta> = {
 *   name: 'My Card Game',
 *   zones: {
 *     hand: { id: 'hand', name: 'Hand', visibility: 'private', ordered: false },
 *     deck: { id: 'deck', name: 'Deck', visibility: 'secret', ordered: true },

 *     playCard: {
 *       condition: (state, context) => true,
