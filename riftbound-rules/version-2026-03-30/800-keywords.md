Beginning on the next turn, this gains [Reaction] and you may play this, ignoring its base cost."


811.1.c. It allows the player to take the Discretionary Action Hide .
811.1.c.1. Hide is not a subset of Play .
811.1.c.2. Hiding a card does not open a chain.
811.1.c.3. Playing a card from facedown (or "from Hidden") does open a chain.
811.1.d. Some choices made while playing a card from Hidden are restricted to the battleﬁeld where it was hidden. A card cannot be played from Hidden if it is a spell with no valid targets under these restrictions. See rule 355.6. Targeting for more information.

811.1.d.1.a. This includes hidden gear, and overrides the normal restriction that gear have in only being allowed to be played to base.
811.1.d.2. If a hidden spell or a play effect of a hidden permanent chooses any targets, those targets must be chosen from among options at that battleﬁeld, unless the ability explicitly restricts targeting in a way that makes this impossible. Example: Blastcone Fae is a unit with Hidden and “When you play me, give a unit -2 [M] this turn, to a minimum of 1 [M].” Because this is a play effect, its target must be chosen from among units at the same battleﬁeld if Blastcone Fae was played from Hidden. Example: Tideturner is a unit with Hidden and “When you play me, you may choose a unit you control at another location. Move me to its location and it to my original location.” Because its play ability has a targeting restriction that can never be fulﬁlled by a unit at its battleﬁeld, its target may be chosen freely from among the available options.
811.1.d.3. If a hidden spell or a play effect of a hidden permanent causes you to play a unit, you must choose to play that unit at that battleﬁeld.
811.2.  Abilities and instructions of hidden cards other than the choices listed above function as normal. Example: Stand United is a spell that has Hidden and says “Buff a friendly unit. Buffs give an additional +1 might to friendly units this turn.” If it’s played from Hidden, the ﬁrst part of its ability must choose a friendly unit at the same battleﬁeld, but the second part of its ability affects all friendly units with buffs, no matter where they are.
811.3.  Instead of being hidden, a card with Hidden may be played for its cost as normal, at its normal timing with no restrictions on targeting.
811.4.  Multiple instances of Hidden are redundant.
811.5.  Hidden, and whether or not a card has Hidden, is a characteristic of the card and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects.
811.5.a. This is independent of the state of being facedown.
811.6.  A card that is Hidden gains Reaction while facedown or played from facedown, and may be played any time a card with Reaction may be played as a result.
811.6.a. The property is granted to the card in its facedown state, and is not publicly known.

812.1.b.2. The [Text] is the Dependent Ability.
812.1.c. As long as a card different than the one with the Legion ability has been Finalized on the same turn then the Dependent Ability is Active on the card with Legion.
812.2.  All instances of Legion on cards a player controls are satisﬁed by that player playing a single card. Example: One card has three different Legion Abilities. The Legion Text of all three abilities will be active as long as one card has been played by the card's controller earlier in the same turn.
